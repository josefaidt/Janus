# Janus
[![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](http://standardjs.com)

A Discord bot built on Node.js using [discordjs](https://discord.js.org/#/) interfacing with cryptocurrency exchanges and as an all-around housebot.

## Early Stages
For information regarding the status of this project, please visit the [trello board](https://trello.com/b/DiDh1BRb) or the [changelog](https://github.com/josefaidt/Janus/blob/master/CHANGELOG.MD).

## The Plan
The initial thought was to begin interfacing the bot to GDAX and Binance/Bittrex API to report major changes, fluctuations, and exchange statuses of the crypto market to my personal discord server. As the bot grows I will be sure to add additional, miscellaneous features.

This bot will end up being containerized using Docker and deployed to a cloud service - either Heroku, AWS, or Google Platform, which will lead to the public release.
